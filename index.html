    <h3>A fully AI generated card game using ChatGPT and DreamStudio.</h3>

    <h2>Game Setup:</h2>
    <p>Each player starts with 20 HP and a deck of 40 cards. Shuffle the deck and draw 5 cards for the starting hand.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
    <p>Players take turns playing cards from their hand. Each turn, you can play one location and one creature or spell.<br>
    Creatures can attack the opponent or their creatures, while spells have various effects.<br>
    Locations provide a persistent effect while they are in play.</p>

    <h2>Attacking:</h2>
    <p>To attack, choose a creature to attack with and choose a target creature or the opponent.<br> 
    The targeted creature or opponent can choose to block the attack with one of their creatures.<br> 
    If the attack is unblocked, the target loses HP equal to the attacking creature's attack value.</p>

    <h2>Winning:</h2>
    <p>The game is won when one player's HP is reduced to 0.</p>

    <h2>Additional Rules:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A creature is removed from the game if its life points reach zero. It is then placed in the discard pile.</li>
      <li>Players are not allowed to look through their decks unless a card specifically allows them to do so.</li>
      <li>If a card's effect contradicts the rules in any way, the card takes precedence.</li>
      <li>A player can only have a maximum of 5 creatures and 5 spells in play at a time.</li>
      <li>Some cards have special abilities that modify the rules of the game or provide a persistent effect while in play. These abilities are described on the card and take effect immediately when played.</li>
      <li>If a player has no cards in their deck and no cards in their hand, they lose the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Have fun playing!</p>
