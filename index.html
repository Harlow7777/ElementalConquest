    <h1>Elemental Conquest</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the game!

    Game Setup:
    Each player starts with 20 HP and a deck of 40 cards. Shuffle the deck and draw 5 cards for the starting hand.

    Gameplay:
    Players take turns playing cards from their hand. Each turn, you can play one location and one creature or spell. Creatures can attack the opponent or their creatures, while spells have various effects. Locations provide a persistent effect while they are in play.

    Attacking:
    To attack, choose a creature to attack with and choose a target creature or the opponent. The targeted creature or opponent can choose to block the attack with one of their creatures. If the attack is unblocked, the target loses HP equal to the attacking creature's attack value.

    Winning:
    The game is won when one player's HP is reduced to 0.

    Additional Rules:
    -A creature is removed from the game if its life points reach zero. It is then placed in the discard pile.
    -Players are not allowed to look through their decks unless a card specifically allows them to do so.
    -If a card's effect contradicts the rules in any way, the card takes precedence
    -A player can only have a maximum of 5 creatures and 5 spells in play at a time.
    -Some cards have special abilities that modify the rules of the game or provide a persistent effect while in play. These abilities are described on the card and take effect immediately when played.
    -If a player has no cards in their deck and no cards in their hand, they lose the game.

      Have fun playing!</p>
